IMPORTANT: this readme file was made after the script was ran, that is why it is not including in the statistics for the current directory tests

note:
- I thought the numbers for the /dev/* folder were very strange and you may have noticed that, but when looking in the file manager on my system they are actually accurate to what my system says. I can provide a screenshot of this info in the future if needed
